In the last half a dozen months two things have happened: I listened to a couple of Freakonomics podcasts that [casted doubt on the effectiveness of advertising](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/advertising-part-1/){target="_blank rel="noopener"}; and [several new companies offering Ultrafast Delivery Services launched in London](https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/online/getir-weezy-and-zapp-the-rapid-delivery-players-leaving-deliveroo-in-the-dust/654345.article){target="_blank rel="noopener"}. 

In the [two-part](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/advertising-part-1/){target="_blank rel="noopener"} Freakonomics podcasts, host Stephen J. Dubner, interviews several academics who have done research that found advertising to be ineffective in increasing sales revenue. 

One study discussed in the podcast looked at two neighbouring regions in the United States, very similar in their socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. The two regions, however, were in two seperate Designate Marketing Areas and thus received very different adverts. 

As such, the researchers could conduct a natural experiment that allowed them to estimate the uplift in sales from the difference in exposure to each advert for the two regions. 

The results from the natural experiment were however quite damning for those advocates of spending a lot on TV advertising.
