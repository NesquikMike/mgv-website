I know lots of people including myself who like to worry a lot. I spend a lot of time thinking about what to do in a [black swan event - "extremely unpredictable events that have massive impacts on human society"](https://www.shortform.com/summary/the-black-swan-summary-nassim-nicholas-taleb){target="_blank rel="noopener"}. 

Friends and family tease me for my obsessions with how to prepare for a potential zombie apocalypse. Guns, tinfood and land are the conclusions I've come to. 

I see the same behaviours in others too. Friends who insist on getting all of their ducks in a row before major life changed. One old school friend is determined to obtain a certain level of income before he has children so that he can send his children to private schools to avoid an unwanted "teenage pregnancy". You might think he's crazy, but many of our school peers, turning 30 this year, currently have teenage children. 

It's understandable that my friend is so determined to send his children to a private school. Many of our classmates are now in prison, and the teaching was often either preoccupied with behaviour management or downright terrible. One history teacher of ours would spend every other lesson reading her emails and once told us how she saw the CEOs of [Pringles](https://www.pringles.com/uk/home.html){target="_blank rel="noopener"} inside a church worshiping Satan. Yes, you did read that right, "CEOs". 

It is easy to see why so many of us have a predisposition to worry. Past humans who hoarded food may have survived famines, or worried about how well liked they were by a powerful chieftain who would sometimes kill those who they disliked. There are many places where these worries are [justified](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/10/world/africa/ethiopia-famine-tigray.html){target="_blank rel="noopener"} [today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jang_Song-thaek#Execution){target="_blank rel="noopener"}. Our ancestors who worried and successfully prepared for dangers will have survived and reproduced, conferring genes that predisposed them to worrying onto us. 

[Some argue that the chronic (as oppposed to episodic) stress that we face about the future is what sperates us from other animals](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Why-Zebras-Dont-Ulcers-Revised/dp/0805073698){target="_blank rel="noopener"}. 

Many of the emotions and behaviours that we have inherited are either too powerful or unsuitable to life in relatively safe 21st century democracies. Our instinct to eat foods that are high in sugars and fats has led to an obesity crisis. It's often obvious that we should not eat that second or third Krispy Kreme doughnut brought into the office by a friendly colleague, but it is a real struggle to override that temptation and often we fail to do so. [Much of the struggle of modern life is overriding those destructive emotions that implore us to take actions that we would regret](/posts/2022/05/mastering-your-own-monkey-brain/){target="_blank rel="noopener"}.

Many of us build a nest egg that will provide some security in the future. The hard work that we invest to obtain a degree that will lead to well paying job, for instance; buying a house so that later we won't have to worry about paying rent or a mortgage; or, saving money for a rainy day. 

These are all healthy behaviours, and often do provide us with a healthy nest egg that we can rely on in the future. 

However, the world can change and the security which your nest egg is providing others today might not be there for you tomorrow. 

My parents were among many in the last century who made the transition from rural tenant farmers to urban workers. My mum grew up in the 70s and 80s on the side of a mountain in [Madeira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeira){target="_blank rel="noopener"}. Her childhood home still does not have a toilet to this day and electricity only arrived in her teenage years. Her parents stopped her and her sibblings education after only three years of schooling so that she could work hard on the farm. She ran away from home to move to the city at the age of 19. 

My grandparents eventually saved enough money to buy a thin strip of land on the steep side of a mountain. This was their nest egg. The security that they hoped to bestow on to their children. They've both passed away now leading to an unresolved squabble amongst my uncles and aunts about how to divide the land. It now sits unused and unusable with trees that are so deeply rooted that they're un-fellable because the land is so steep. 

The rapid urbanization and improvements in agriculture of the last century led to a loss in the value of the investments that my grandparents viewed as traditionally providing security. They were unable to understand how the world was changing and what it meant for them. 

I tell you this cautionary tale, not to make you worry more about how the world can change and what that might mean for your investments, but to remind you and to remind myself to enjoy the present. I'm not saying that we should not prepare for the future, of course we should. But, we should not let saving for the future consume us today.
