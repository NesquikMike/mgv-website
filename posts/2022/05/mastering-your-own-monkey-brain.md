Since university I have struggled with OCD. As a result I've learnt a lot about mental processes. Recently I've come to understand a lot more about my own mental condition. Through a variety of experiences and activities it has become clear to me that most of my actions are governed by habit and instinctive decision making rather than conscious decision making. 

## The Human Brain is not Optimised for early 21st century life

## Much of human behaviour is instinctive and habitual (slow brain, not fast)

## Sports training is analagous and indicative of our ability to learn new habits

## Humans often end up doing the monkey brain thing (status, sex, power) but explaining it to themselves differently

When I was doing my masters I really wanted a Macbook Pro. If you had asked me at the time why I wanted it, I would have said it's easily the best machine. Looking back now it is obvious that I was trying to imitate those that I saw around me who I interpreted as being socially superior. 

## Many behaviours are a by-product of other behaviours

Recently my upstairs neighbour was playing music very loudly at 10.30pm when I was about to go to bed to sleep for the next day. I've had problems with bad neighbours in the past. And since I have been making an attempt recently to be more assertive despite my inhibitions, whereas in the past I would have avoided asking her to turn the music down, in this case I decided to do so. So I knocked on her door, she answered and was drunk. I asked her to turn it down and she said she would before starting to make several excuses for herself for being drunk, while saying that she wasn't trying to make excuses for herself.

As group animals we balance securing and often maximising our own access to resources and maintaing membership of our group. Our access to resources is greatly enhanced by co-operation with the rest of our group. A band of hunter-gatherers all benefit by co-operating to catch a Woolly Mammoth to eat, compared to individually foraging for nuts and seeds. But, because there are many resources which cannot be [public goods](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/public-good.asp) - resources that are easily accessible to all and whose supply remains constant even with use by others, such as the air that we breathe - it is near impossible to sustain complete selflessness in a group with limited resources without running counter to the aims of natural selection. In a famine those who are selfless and give up their food do not reproduce and their selfless genes don't replicate.[^1] Resources must be distributed amongst the group for which individual members compete. The most prominent examples being housing, romantic partners and food. We can't all live in Buckingham Palace, date Rihanna and eat [White Truffles](https://royalcaviarclub.com/blogs/news/white-truffles-expensive-alba-tuber-magnatum). 

Only relatively recently in British society, and still today in other countries your immediate survival depends on your status and ability to retain your position as an agricultural labour.[^2] 


Examples of these are distribution of food that is produced by the group,
