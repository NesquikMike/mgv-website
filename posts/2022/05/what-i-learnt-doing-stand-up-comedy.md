From March to April 2022 I took part in a 6 week stand-up comedy course for beginners at [The Comedy Store](https://www.thecomedystore.co.uk/){target="_blank rel="noopener"} in Central London. At the end of the course [myself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6miCy-nmXIY){target="_blank rel="noopener"}, and the other comedians had to perform a 5 minute set in front of an audience of over 150 people. Here are some of the things that I learnt from taking part in this course. 

## 1. First Impressions are Deceiving
In the first week of the course myself and 14 other comedians arrived at the London Comedy Store for our first lesson. The aim of the first lesson was to get us all use to being on stage. We each had to stand up, introduce ourselves and tell a truth and a lie about ourselves. 

Most of my fellow comedians came up on stage and had a very confident presence. I couldn't help but feel slightly inadequate in comparison to the ease with which they could express themselves on stage.   

Inevitably I couldn't help but start making predictions about who I thought would be the funniest comedians at the end of the show. I predicted that myself and one other very shy and nervous comedian, Rajesh (not their real name), would be the least funny comedians in the final show. I was completely wrong. After the show everyone I spoke to was in complete agreement that Rajesh was the funniest comic out of the 13 comics who performed in the final show, and that I was in the top three. 

Me and Rajesh were similar, we were nervous but enjoyed the limelight of rehearsing in front of our peers; simultaneous competing instincts to be hide and be seen. The two of us were always the most eager to try our new material. 

In the end we all put on a great show. But, some of the comics who I initially felt would be best, and who I couldn't help but find slightly intimidating, put on some of the more average performances. 

## 2. Fail Fast, Fail Often, but Failing Hurts & it's Important to Push Through
As a programmer I'm really inspired by the IDEO cofounder David Kelly's mantra "Fail fast, fail often"[^1]. I think the approach of rapid iteration is integral to the development of good products, and is useful also in a lot of other areas of life.  

But it can be a very hard process to go through. Failure hurts. 

There is often a very mechanical logic to what makes a joke funny, but it is often not clear how funny something is until you actually perform it to an audience. Often I was surprised, some jokes were much funnier than I expected whereas others got no response at all. 

It's for this reason that some of the most successful stand up comics like [Chris Rock](https://www.hollywood.com/general/chris-rock-surprises-comedy-club-crowd-with-impromptu-set-60761287) still perform at small clubs. They're testing new material to gauge how funny it is so that they can continue iterating before an upcoming big show.

However, the beginning of this process is painful. In week 3 and 4 of the course we started testing jokes that we had written on the instructor and our fellow comics. It was a brutal experience for us all. We were all taken aback by how difficult it is to get a response from our audience. 

One comedian remarked to me how these lessons felt like being "run over by a car." 

One comic was very close to tears after performing his material in front of us in the fourth week. He gave up testing his new jokes on us, saying that "it knocked his confidence". His final performance was one of the worst out of all of the comedians. It was a shame as I felt his analyses of what was funny about other acts was one of the best and that his inhibition had stopped him from meeting his massive potential. 

## 3. Writing Jokes is Hard, but is Surprisingly Logical

Most of what is funny in conversation with friends is not funny in stand-up. 

A few months ago I took my girlfriend across town by bus to collect a takeaway delivery rucksack from a colleague. It was an adventure. 

The rucksack was so big that on our way back home it was bumping everyone on the bus; it was hitting all the bus handles; and, I got stuck climbing the staircase trying to twist my body towards the landing on the upper deck. The funniest bit was when we overheard a group of teenage girls giggling to themselves that the bus is a very slow way to be delivering takeaway.  

Telling that story to friends in casual conversations got a great reaction. 

I prepared this and some other embarassing stories to deliver to my fellow comics in one of the rehearsals. I expected to get a lot of laughs, instead I got stone wall silence.  

I was told the stories "were engaging but not funny". 

The best response I got were from jokes where I thought about something in my life and tried to relate it to something obscurely related and/or silly. 

I learnt from this that Jokes need punchlines. 

Most jokes have a three part setup. The classic rule-of-three is “Monday, Tuesday, Banana”. The first two components, which create an expectation, are the set-up; and, the third that confounds the expectation is the payoff. 

To take an example from Jimmy Carr. 

1. A lady with a clipboard stopped me in the street the other day.
2. She said, "Can you spare a few minutes for Cancer Research?" 
3. I said, "All right, but we're not going to get much done.” 

This is a "taking things literally" type of joke that incorporates the Rule of Three. The payoff comes from the inexact fit of the last part of the joke. It's not expected and it *can be* fit into the context of what was said previously. This final confoundment of expectations is often the key component of funny jokes.

## 4. People's Stereotypes About You are Important

In the second week of the course each comedian had to get on stage and have their persona evaluated by their fellow comedians. 

One reason for this is that it is more difficult for a stand-up comic to get laughs from their jokes if their jokes and delivery does not much the audience's perception of who they are as a person. For instance, at one point I experimented with a joke that started "I love stuffing food inside my f\*\*cking face". The other comics agreed that shouldn't use the word "f\*\*king" in an aggressive manner in my set as it did not fit in with my character.  

Also, if a comic has been blessed or cursed with a prominent feature it's best for the comic to address it at the beginning of the set. Otherwise, the audience will fixate on it and pay less attention to the comics jokes. Addressing the feature relieves the tension in the audience about it. 

One of the comics on the course, who we will call Angela, had a large birthmark on her cheek. Our instructor asked if she was going to address it and she answered that she preferred not to. The following week Angela had prepared an opening joke about her birthmark that was well received.  

## 5. People are Sensitive

In the persona evaluations the other comics were told to be brutally honest. 

Some of the things comics were told they look like included "arrogant c\*\*t", "oxford educated media t\*\*t", "ugly face". 

This experience of having their persona evaluated was one of the most brutal for a lot of the comics. We all knew it would hurt to get up on stage and receive that feedback from our fellow comice, but it didn't soften the blow. A few managed to keep their composure but most of us visibly struggled with the feedback. 

## 6. Have a Weirdness

Robert Greene's 46th law in his book *The 48 Laws of Power* is to never appear too perfect. "[It is smart to occasionally display defects, and admit to harmless vices, in order to... appear more human and approachable](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/246815-law-46-never-appear-too-perfect-appearing-better-than-others)."

People can't help but laugh at eccentrics. It's reassuring to see people so much odder than us embarass themselves by openly displaying their eccentricity in public. They put us at ease and we take pleasure from their unusual viewpoints and weird behaviours. 

In my set, I leveraged my unusual interest in London Buses. The many unusual aspects of my interest - such as my knowledge of different bus vehicles, something most people barely register - were easily exploitable for joke writing. It also made for one of the most memorable acts.
