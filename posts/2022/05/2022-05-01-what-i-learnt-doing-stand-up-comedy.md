From March to April 2022 I took part in a 6 week stand-up comedy course for beginners at [The Comedy Store](https://www.thecomedystore.co.uk/){target="_blank rel="noopener"} in Central London. At the end of the course all of the comedians had to perform a 5 minute set in front of an audience of over 150 people. Here are some of the things that I learnt from taking part in this course. You can see my set here. 

## 1. First Impressions are Deceiving
In the first week of the course myself and 14 other comedians arrived at the London Comedy Store for our first lesson. The aim of the first lesson was to get us all use to being on stage. We each had to stand up, introduce ourselves and tell a truth and a lie about ourselves. 

Most of my fellow comedians came up on stage and had a very confident presence. Being a bit shy, I couldn't help but feel slightly inadequate in comparison to the ease with which my peers could express themselves on stage.   

Inevitably I couldn't help but start making predictions about who I thought would be the funniest comedians at the end of the show. I predicted that myself and one other very shy and nervous comedian, who we will call Rajesh, would be the least funny comedians in the final show. I was completely wrong. After the show everyone I spoke to was in complete agreement that Rajesh was the funniest comic out of the 13 comics who performed in the final show. 

It was amazing to see myself and Rajesh's progress as the course went on. Me and Rajesh were similar in that we were both very nervous but we enjoyed the limelight of rehearsing in front of our peers. The two of us were always the most eager to try out our new material. 

In the end we all put on a great show. But, some of the comics who I felt would be most impressive, and who I couldn't help but find slightly intimidating, put on some of the more average performances. 

## Writing Jokes is Hard, but has a Surprising Logic

Writing jokes needs a lot of testing and iteration. 

## 2. Fail Fast, Fail Often, but Failing Hurts & it's Important to Push Through
As a programmer I'm really inspired by the IDEO cofounder David Kelly's mantra "Fail fast, fail often" *p229, The Design of Everyday Things by Donald A. Norman*. I think the approach of rapid iteration is integral to the development of good products, and is useful also in a lot of other areas of life.  

But it can be a very hard process to go through. Failure hurts. 

There is often a very mechanical logic to what makes a joke funny, but it is often not clear how funny something is until you actually perform it to an audience. Often I was surprised at the amplitude of the laughter response that I would get for more jokes. Some were much funnier than I expected whereas others got no response at all.  

It's for this reason that some of the most successful stand up comics like [Chris Rock](https://www.hollywood.com/general/chris-rock-surprises-comedy-club-crowd-with-impromptu-set-60761287) still perform at small clubs. They're testing new material to gauge how funny it is so that they can continue iterating before an upcoming big show.

However, the beginning of this process is painful. In week 3 and 4 of the course we started testing jokes that we had written on the instructor and our fellow comics. It was a brutal experience for us all. We were all taken aback by how difficult it is to get a response from our audience. 

One comedian remarked to me how these lessons felt like being "run over by a car." 

One comic was very close to tears after performing his material in front of us in the fourth week, he gave up testing his new jokes on us after that since he felt that it knocked his confidence. His final performance was one of the worst out of all of the comedians. It was a shame as I felt his analyses of what was funny about other acts was one of the best and that his inhibition had stopped him from meeting his massive potential. 

## 3. People are Sensitive
In the second week of the course each comedian had to get on stage and have their persona evaluated by their fellow comedians. 

One reason for this is that it is more difficult for a stand-up comic to get laughs from their jokes if their jokes and delivery does not much the audience's perception of who they are as a person. For instance, at one point I experimented with a joke that started "I love stuffing food inside my f\*\*cking face". The other comics agreed that shouldn't use the word "f\*\*king" in an aggressive manner in my set as it did not fit in with my character.  

Also, if a comic has been blessed or cursed with a prominent feature it's best for the comic to address it at the beginning of the set. Otherwise, the audience will fixate on it and pay less attention to the comics jokes. Addressing the feature relieves the tension in the audience about it. 

One of the comics on the course, who we will call Angela, had a large birthmark on her cheek. Our instructor asked if she was going to address it and she answered that she preferred not to. The following week Angela had prepared an opening joke about her birthmark that was well received.  

In the persona evaluations the other comics were told to be brutally honest. One comic was told he looked like an "arrogant c**t".  

This experience of having their persona evaluated was one of the most brutal for a lot of the comics. A few managed to keep their composure but most of us visibly struggled with the feedback.
