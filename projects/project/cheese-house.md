Me and my girlfriend [Beth](betharchibald.co.uk){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} were holidaying with family at The Cheese House. Practicing my web developments skills and [her graphic design skills](betharchibald.co.uk){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} we built a simple static webpage with an online menu for the family dinner that we were cooking. I use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to host it. Check out the Cheese jokes page for some cheesy (no pun intended ) jokes and some interactive buttons using only CSS no JS.
