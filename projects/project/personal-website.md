My personal website uses the [11ty.dev](11ty.dev){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} static site generator. Inspired by this [Vanilla 11ty.js starter blog](https://eleventy-dot-js-blog.netlify.app/){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, it uses `.11ty.js` files for layouts instead of other template languages like `liquid` or `nunjacks`. It's hosted on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. I use it for blogging and to promote my personal projects.
