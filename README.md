# Personal Website

This blog is built using [eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/docs/).

To serve it for development purposes run `npm run serve`.

To build it for a production release run `npm run build`.

## Design Choices

### Font

21px font has been chosen as the default for the website. This is so that the website emulates Medium with a big font that is easy to read on screens. The inspiration for this choice can be found [here](https://learnui.design/blog/mobile-desktop-website-font-size-guidelines.html).

Garamond has been chosen as font for the website. This is because it is a websafe font that is accessible on all browsers without download. This is in keeping with the website's aim to be accessible to those with low internet speeds. 

### Colour Scheme

I am a fan of the Data Journalism done by the Financial Times, so I wanted a [colour scheme that would reference the publication](https://www.schemecolor.com/financial-times-web-site.php). I have chosen to use Old Lace (#FFF1E0) as my main colour for the website. 

The color palette was generated using [](http://colormind.io/bootstrap/) with Old Lace as the main color. 

|Use Case|Colour|Notes|
--- | --- | ---
|Main brand color|#FFF1E0||
|Light color|#F0F1F3|Use this color as the background for dark-on-light designs, or the text color of an inverted design.|
|Dark color|#5E6D8F|Use as the text color for dark-on-light designs, or as the background for inverted designs.|
|Light Accent|#A9978E|Accent colors can be used to bring attention to design elements by contrasting with the rest of the palette.|
|Dark Accent|#BA7781|Another accent color to consider. Not all colors have to be used - sometimes a simple color scheme works best.|
